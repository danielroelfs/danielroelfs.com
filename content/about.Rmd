I'm Daniel Roelfs, I'm a PhD candidate working at the Norwegian Centre for Mental Disorders Research (NORMENT) in Oslo. My research focuses on the intersection between neuroimaging and genetics to discover more about the human brain and schizophrenia in particular. I'm enrolled in a doctoral education programme at the University of Oslo.

Originally from the Netherlands, I have also studied in France and Sweden before moving to Norway. In my free time I ski, photograph, and make music. And this blog serves as a way to share some of the weird code I write for R.
