In my free time I enjoy photography. Since I live in Norway, every hike is an opportunity to see some amazing landscapes. Besides that my interests also extend to cityscapes, lifestyle pictures, and portraits.

See the website for my photography here: <a href="https://photography.danielroelfs.com" target="_blank">photography.danielroelfs.com</a>
