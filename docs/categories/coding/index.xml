      <description>Introduction If there was a statistics magazine and it were to have ads, the ad for independent component analysis (commonly referred to as the ICA) might read something like this:
 Do you ever find yourself with a large number of highly related variables? Are you interested in studying constructs rather than specific measures? Would you rather work with a small number of variables each capturing a large amount of variance instead of a large number of variables each capturing a small amount of variance?</description>

      <title>Plotting Star Destroyers in R</title>

      <description>Introduction Most people in my environment know R as the quintessential tool for statistical analysis and data visualization. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of tutorials and discussions online about how to go about either. But one important aspect that is noticeably lacking is a discussion about R&amp;rsquo;s ability to simulate scenes from Star Wars. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll set this straight. At the same time we&amp;rsquo;ll also explore how to incorporate a mathematical formula with a set of simple rules into R.</description>

      <title>How I Make QQ Plots Using ggplot</title>

      <description>Introduction Whenever I show my colleagues in the genetics group my results, the first things they say are &amp;ldquo;can you show me the Manhattan plots?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;can you show me the QQ plots?&amp;rdquo;. I covered how to make Manhattan plots in ggplot before (click here for a link. But now I want to go through how I make QQ plots. I&amp;rsquo;m aware that there&amp;rsquo;s a number of packages available that offer this funcionality, but I feel they&amp;rsquo;re for the most part a bit limiting compared to making the plot yourself using the {ggplot2} package.</description>

The documentary discussed parts of Bach&amp;rsquo;s life and the music he wrote during it.</description>

      <description>Introduction There are many ways to create a Manhattan plot. There&amp;rsquo;s a number of online tools that create Manhattan plots for you, it&amp;rsquo;s implemented in a number of toolboxes that are often used in genetics, and there&amp;rsquo;s a couple of packages for R that can create these plots. However, these options often don&amp;rsquo;t offer the customizability that some people (like me) would want. One of the most flexible ways to plot a Manhattan plot (I know of) is the {manhattan} package, but how nice would it be to have full control over the properties of the plot.</description>

      <title>How I Plot ERPs in R</title>

      <description>Introduction Plotting ERPs is one of the essential skills in EEG neuroscience. There are many possible ways of going about this task, some better than others. Myself, I use either MATLAB or R to plot ERPs. In my experience, MATLAB is by far the preferred method since most of the EEG analysis takes place in MATLAB already, but I believe that there&amp;rsquo;s some merit to using R. One of my main arguments is aesthetics.</description>
