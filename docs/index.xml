      <description>body { background-color: #EBEBEB; /* was #EFEFEF */ } table { font-family: &#34;Nunito Sans&#34;, sans-serif; } code { background: #E0E0E0; }  For this post, I decided to hide most of the code chuncks to improve legibility. All figures and tables were created with the {ggplot} and {gt} packages. If you want to see how I created these plots, look at the Rmarkdown file

      <description>Introduction If there was a statistics magazine and it were to have ads, the ad for independent component analysis (commonly referred to as the ICA) might read something like this:
 Do you ever find yourself with a large number of highly related variables? Are you interested in studying constructs rather than specific measures? Would you rather work with a small number of variables each capturing a large amount of variance instead of a large number of variables each capturing a small amount of variance?</description>

      <title>Plotting Star Destroyers in R</title>

      <description>Introduction Most people in my environment know R as the quintessential tool for statistical analysis and data visualization. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of tutorials and discussions online about how to go about either. But one important aspect that is noticeably lacking is a discussion about R&amp;rsquo;s ability to simulate scenes from Star Wars. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll set this straight. At the same time we&amp;rsquo;ll also explore how to incorporate a mathematical formula with a set of simple rules into R.</description>

      <description>Introduction Whenever I show my colleagues in the genetics group my results, the first things they say are &amp;ldquo;can you show me the Manhattan plots?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;can you show me the QQ plots?&amp;rdquo;. I covered how to make Manhattan plots in ggplot before (click here for a link. But now I want to go through how I make QQ plots. I&amp;rsquo;m aware that there&amp;rsquo;s a number of packages available that offer this funcionality, but I feel they&amp;rsquo;re for the most part a bit limiting compared to making the plot yourself using the {ggplot2} package.</description>

The documentary discussed parts of Bach&amp;rsquo;s life and the music he wrote during it.</description>

      <description>Introduction There are many ways to create a Manhattan plot. There&amp;rsquo;s a number of online tools that create Manhattan plots for you, it&amp;rsquo;s implemented in a number of toolboxes that are often used in genetics, and there&amp;rsquo;s a couple of packages for R that can create these plots. However, these options often don&amp;rsquo;t offer the customizability that some people (like me) would want. One of the most flexible ways to plot a Manhattan plot (I know of) is the {manhattan} package, but how nice would it be to have full control over the properties of the plot.</description>

      <title>How I Plot ERPs in R</title>

      <description>Introduction Plotting ERPs is one of the essential skills in EEG neuroscience. There are many possible ways of going about this task, some better than others. Myself, I use either MATLAB or R to plot ERPs. In my experience, MATLAB is by far the preferred method since most of the EEG analysis takes place in MATLAB already, but I believe that there’s some merit to using R. One of my main arguments is aesthetics.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Daniel Roelfs, I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate working at the Norwegian Centre for Mental Disorders Research (NORMENT) in Oslo. My research focuses on the intersection between neuroimaging and genetics to discover more about the human brain and schizophrenia in particular. I&amp;rsquo;m enrolled in a doctoral education programme at the University of Oslo.
Originally from the Netherlands, I have also studied in France and Sweden before moving to Norway. In my free time I ski, photograph, and make music.</description>
