      <description>The 2022 Winter Olympics started last week. I&amp;rsquo;m don&amp;rsquo;t usually follow sports (of any kind) religiously during a regular year, but I make an exception for the Winter Olympics. In particular the speed skating events I&amp;rsquo;ll watch live as much as time allows me. It&amp;rsquo;s no secret the Netherlands is a speed skating nation (although some international TV commentators don&amp;rsquo;t quite grasp why). Is it fun to watch a sport where you have a high chance of winning?</description>
