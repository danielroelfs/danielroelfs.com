      <description>Introduction A little while ago I was watching a documentary series on Dutch television about one of the most important composers in the Netherlands: Johann Sebastian Bach. The documentary discussed parts of Bach&amp;rsquo;s life and the music he wrote during it. This documentary inspired me to learn more about the pieces Bach wrote, and since this is my life now, I might as well do it in R.
