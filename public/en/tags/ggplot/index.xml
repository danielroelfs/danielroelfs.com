      <description>As of March 2023 {fhimaps} and {splmaps} are no longer supported due to budget cuts at the institution supporting them. The amazing developers (led by Richard Aubrey White and Chi Zhang) have moved the data and functionality to a new package called {csmaps}. The code below is updated to reflect the changes. Every now and then you discover a discover a much simpler solution to a problem you spent a lot of time solving.</description>

      <description>For this post, I decided to hide the code chunks by default to improve legibility. You can click the Show code-button to expand the code. Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m at the age where a lot of my peers start thinking about buying a home. It is a major conversation topic around the office, and these conversations are not often filled with optimism and excitement. Oslo is a notoriously expensive city to live in, and the housing market is very tough.</description>

      <title>Plotting Star Destroyers in R</title>

      <description>Introduction Most people in my environment know R as the quintessential tool for statistical analysis and data visualization. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of tutorials and discussions online about how to go about either. But one important aspect that is noticeably lacking is a discussion about R&amp;rsquo;s ability to simulate scenes from Star Wars. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll set this straight. At the same time we&amp;rsquo;ll also explore how to incorporate a mathematical formula with a set of simple rules into R.</description>

      <title>How I Make QQ Plots Using ggplot</title>

      <description>Introduction Whenever I show my colleagues in the genetics group my results, the first things they say are &amp;ldquo;can you show me the Manhattan plots?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;can you show me the QQ plots?&amp;rdquo;. I covered how to make Manhattan plots in ggplot before (click here for a link. But now I want to go through how I make QQ plots. I&amp;rsquo;m aware that there&amp;rsquo;s a number of packages available that offer this funcionality, but I feel they&amp;rsquo;re for the most part a bit limiting compared to making the plot yourself using the {ggplot2} package.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Bach</title>

      <description>Introduction A little while ago I was watching a documentary series on Dutch television about one of the most important composers in the Netherlands: Johann Sebastian Bach. The documentary discussed parts of Bach&amp;rsquo;s life and the music he wrote during it. This documentary inspired me to learn more about the pieces Bach wrote, and since this is my life now, I might as well do it in R.
Collecting the data In my search of a dataset, I found this old website, looking like it last got a major update in 2003, made by what appeared to be a Bach enthousiast called Bryen Travis.</description>

      <description>Introduction There are many ways to create a Manhattan plot. There&amp;rsquo;s a number of online tools that create Manhattan plots for you, it&amp;rsquo;s implemented in a number of toolboxes that are often used in genetics, and there&amp;rsquo;s a couple of packages for R that can create these plots. However, these options often don&amp;rsquo;t offer the customizability that some people (like me) would want. One of the most flexible ways to plot a Manhattan plot (I know of) is the {manhattan} package, but how nice would it be to have full control over the properties of the plot.</description>

      <title>How I Plot ERPs in R</title>

      <description>Introduction Plotting ERPs is one of the essential skills in EEG neuroscience. There are many possible ways of going about this task, some better than others. Myself, I use either MATLAB or R to plot ERPs. In my experience, MATLAB is by far the preferred method since most of the EEG analysis takes place in MATLAB already, but I believe that there&amp;rsquo;s some merit to using R. One of my main arguments is aesthetics.</description>
