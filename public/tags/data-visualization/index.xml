      <description>Today I want to share a project that deals with data scientist&amp;rsquo;s favorite kind of data: date- and timedata involving time zones and daylight savings time. Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love it?
This project stems from a discussion I had with my family about living up north in Norway and when the days become longer than in the Netherlands. Intuitively, one might think that because of the prevailing snow and cold in March and occasionally April this corresponds with shorter day length.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine you&amp;rsquo;re incredibly lazy and you want to learn R, but you only want to learn one function to do statistics. What function do you learn? I&amp;rsquo;d recommend to learn to use the lm() function. Why? Because most common statistical tests are in fact nothing more than some variation of a linear model, from the simplest One-Sample T-test to a repeated-measures ANOVA. I think most people that have Googled for this question have found Jonas Lindel√∏v&amp;rsquo;s post on how common statistical tests are linear models (as they should, it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing post).</description>

      <description>The 2022 Winter Olympics started last week. I&amp;rsquo;m don&amp;rsquo;t usually follow sports (of any kind) religiously during a regular year, but I make an exception for the Winter Olympics. In particular the speed skating events I&amp;rsquo;ll watch live as much as time allows me. It&amp;rsquo;s no secret the Netherlands is a speed skating nation (although some international TV commentators don&amp;rsquo;t quite grasp why). Is it fun to watch a sport where you have a high chance of winning?</description>
