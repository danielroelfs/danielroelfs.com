      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine you&amp;rsquo;re incredibly lazy and you want to learn R, but you only want to learn one function to do statistics. What function do you learn? I&amp;rsquo;d recommend to learn to use the lm() function. Why? Because most common statistical tests are in fact nothing more than some variation of a linear model, from the simplest One-Sample T-test to a repeated-measures ANOVA. I think most people that have Googled for this question have found Jonas Lindel√∏v&amp;rsquo;s post on how common statistical tests are linear models (as they should, it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing post).</description>

      <description>This is just a very quick blog post outlining some of the commonalities and differences between factor analysis (FA), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA). I was inspired to write some of this down through some confusion caused in the lab by SPSS&#39; apparent dual usage of the term &amp;ldquo;factor analysis&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;principal components&amp;rdquo;. A few of my colleagues who use SPSS showed me the following screen:</description>

      <description>Introduction If there was a statistics magazine and it were to have ads, the ad for independent component analysis (commonly referred to as the ICA) might read something like this:
 Do you ever find yourself with a large number of highly related variables? Are you interested in studying constructs rather than specific measures? Would you rather work with a small number of variables each capturing a large amount of variance instead of a large number of variables each capturing a small amount of variance?</description>
